				<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen,</span></span></p>
			<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">
				<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">I take this opportunity to place on record the successful completion three years of this super specialised university, which was started with an aim to provide education of international standards to the students in the area of forensic science, criminology, behavioural science and other allied subjects. The university is a first of its kind in the world and we are trying to see that we provide the best services to the students and create excellent job placement opportunities for them. There is an acute need of forensic experts in the world and to cater to the needs of the country and the world, the university decided to start various courses.</span></span></p>
			<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">
				<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">The university mainly runs courses which are after graduation. The important courses are&hellip; Masters in Forensic Science, Masters in Forensic Pharmacy, Master in Forensic Nanotechnology, Masters in Digital Forensics, Masters in Forensic Psychology, etc. We also have some PG Diploma Courses in various areas of forensic science. The university has also made some registrations for PhD degree. We have quite numbers of students who are doing PhD in different areas. In a span of three years, I am happy to note that 3 students have been awarded PhD degrees by the university. The university also has taken note to motivate the students by declaring some awards for the meritorious students of different disciplines so that the student who performs the best can be awarded with some medal or some prize.</span></span></p>
			<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">
				<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">We also have a separate placement cell to take care of the placements of the students after their education. We also have established an international co-ordination cell where we handle all affairs related to international areas of the university. We have made agreements, i.e., MoUs with, almost 20 institutes of international and national repute for joint research and academic activities in this area. There are research centers from different parts of the country who have approached us for getting recognitions for research in various areas. They also include areas like information technology, the area of bio-technology, the area of water pollution and other allied areas. Thus, we are trying to see that we give the best education and we also do remarkable research activities in the area which needs more and more expertise in the field because the investigation of crimes which are being committed now need more and more application of technologies. If we have more experts who are experts in using technologies, experts in investigating various kind of crimes, will definitely serve the society in a better way and our ultimate goal is to see that we make the society safe.</span></span></p>
			<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">
				<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">At last, I would like to thank the Government of Gujarat and specially the Chief Minister of the Government of Gujarat for whole-hearted support to this university. I also wish a very bright future to those who are associated with this university and I am sure you will have a comfortable and memorable stay with us.</span></span></p>
			<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">
				<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;">Thank You.</span></span></p>
